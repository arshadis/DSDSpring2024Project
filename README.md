# Univercity Parking Control System UPCS

MY project is to write and present a verilog code for contoling the entries of a parking.

## Tools
I used tho essential tool. For compiling and simulation I used Modelsim and for IDE I used VScode.
- Modelsim
- VScode

## Implementation Details

The details of implemntation of my project is described in the document that was uploaded.
But hear is a breif:
1- Define parameters:
2- Calculate free capacity based on the current hour.
3- Maintain counters for university and non-university cars.
4- Update counters on car entry and exit.
5- Calculate available vacant spaces for both types of cars.

## How to Run

To run the application please follow this steps:

1- Create new project and write the codes

## Results
The result of code is in the doc but a coclurion of project is that we can use verilog to solve the real world problems and most of all we can synthesis our synthesisable code to get the hardwar of program.
